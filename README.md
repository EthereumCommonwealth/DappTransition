# Callisto Network offers DAPP transition service.

### Port your DAPP from one platform to another 

The rapid evolution of production chain technologies has given rise to several dApps platforms, each with its characteristics and specifics. Depending on the technological development of these platforms, it may make sense for a developer to migrate from one platform to another.

Callisto Network aims to be an open market where DAPP developers can request the transition from their current platform to any existing alternative and competent developers familiar with both platforms could accept and handle their request.

**At the moment we offer the opportunity to port DAPPs from Ethereum to EOS.**

### Submitting a transition request

Create request directly:

- Go to [DappTransition/issues](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/DappTransition/issues) section and click a [New Issue button](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/DappTransition/issues/new).
- Fill the form and click a "Submit New Issue" button.
- Follow the comments in the corresponding "issue" discussion.
- The result (source code of the contract) be delivered to the applicant's email specified in the corresponding 'github issue'.

Please, keep in mind that transition requester must provide the following information in the request:

1. Source code of the existing DAPP.
2. Contact email.
3. Brief description of the platform and what the contract must be doing. It is possible to provide the link to the technical whitepaper or contract documentation instead.
