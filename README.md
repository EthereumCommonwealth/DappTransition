# Callisto Network offers DAPP transition service.

### Port your DAPP from one platform to another 

The rapid evolution of production chain technologies has given rise to several dApps platforms, each with its characteristics and specifics. Depending on the technological development of these platforms, it may make sense for a developer to migrate from one platform to another.

Callisto Network aims to be an open market where DAPP developers can request the transition from their current platform to any existing alternative and competent developers familiar with both platforms could accept and handle their request.

**At the moment we offer the opportunity to port DAPPs from Ethereum to EOS.**

It should be noted that the structure of EOS is significantly different from Ethereum. Therefore it may be necessary to provide a proper explanation of deploying a DAPP on the EOS platform in addition to the rewriting the code of the contract.

### Submitting a transition request

Create request directly:

- Go to [DappTransition/issues](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/DappTransition/issues) section and click a [New Issue button](https://github.com/EthereumCommonwealth/DappTransition/issues/new).
- Fill the form and click a "Submit New Issue" button.
- Follow the comments in the corresponding "issue" discussion.
- The result (source code of the contract) be delivered to the applicant's email specified in the corresponding 'github issue'.

Please, keep in mind that transition requester must provide the following information in the request:

1. Source code of the existing DAPP.
2. Contact email.
3. Brief description of the platform and what the contract must be doing. It is possible to provide the link to the technical whitepaper or contract documentation instead.

### The process

The service consists in the rewriting of any Solidity smart contract in C++ compatible with EOS.

During the process, smart-contract developers will read, understand, modify, and re-implement every line of code to adapt the existing smart contract to EOS while preserving all the original functionalities.

We deliver:

- The final source code (public or private).
- The smart contract deployed (if it was specifically agreed with the requester).
- The documentation of the new smart contract.
- The guidance and technical support after the EOS contract is deployed.

### Costs

At the moment, we will evaluate each request separately and set a price depending on how difficult it is to port this contract and how long it will take to process the request.

After receiving payment, the developers will start working on the request. After the request has been completed, Callisto will withhold a fixed fee of 3.5% for handling the request and governing the process as well as verifying the final contract. After that the developer who handled the request will receive the remaining payment.

### Alternative ways to submit a transition request

As the result, a github issue for your request will be created anyways. In any of the alternative ways described below the issue will be created by Callisto Team member.

#### 1. Transition request can be submitted by email

Send your request to dexaran@callisto.network

Please, provide the necessary information: project description, contract source codes

#### 2. Transition request can be submitted via the Migration Form at Callisto.network website

Fill in the form here: https://callisto.network/smart-contract-migration/

#### 3. Transition request can be submitted via twitter announcement

Submit a tweet with `CLOne_me_to_eos` hashtag. Provide your contact email and project name in the tweet. Provide the `$CLO` hashtag in the tweet.
